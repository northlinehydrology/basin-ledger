"""Surface routes, the utility chain and rules on the synthetic example (examples/synthetic/surface.toml).

A mill takes from Osu_1hru's channel through a SWAT+ water allocation place of use and returns through a point
source. The plant is on a utility that pumps a well and discharges to the channel through the treatment plant's
point source. Three rules act on the users. Two years, with the users and without (the baseline still has the
utility's existing customers).
